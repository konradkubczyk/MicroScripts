# ðŸ“œ My collection of scripts

This repository contains a collection of [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) scripts I've written for various purposes. Some of them may be useful, others not so much...

Feel free to try them out and if you find any bugs or have a suggestion, please [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/konradkubczyk/microscripts/-/issues) or [submit a merge request](https://gitlab.com/konradkubczyk/microscripts/-/merge_requests).

## List of contents

Currently, the following scripts are available:

- [image-downsizer](image-downsizer) - downsizes images in a directory to a specified maximum width or height using [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)
