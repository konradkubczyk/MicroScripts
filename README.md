# ðŸ“œ My collection of scripts

This repository contains a collection of [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) scripts I've written for various purposes. Some of them may be useful, others not so much...

Feel free to try them out and if you find any bugs or have a suggestion, please [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/konradkubczyk/microscripts/-/issues) or [submit a merge request](https://gitlab.com/konradkubczyk/microscripts/-/merge_requests).

The scripts are independent of each other, so you can download only the ones you need.

## List of contents

These are the scripts currently available in this repository:

- [image-downsizer](image-downsizer) - downsizes images in a directory to a specified maximum width or height using [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)
- [webm-to-mp4](webm-to-mp4) - converts WebM files to MP4 using [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
- [bulk-image-trimmer](bulk-image-trimmer) - trims images in a directory in bulk to remove empty space surrounding the content using [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)

Click on the name to go to the script's directory.

## Requirements

[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is a requirement for all scripts, but some of them may need additional software to work properly. Please refer to the README.md file located in the script's directory for more information.

All the scripts were tested on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) Linux.
