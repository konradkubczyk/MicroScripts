# Image downsizer

This script downsizes images in the selected directory, so that the width or height of the resulting images are no more than the specified maximum. The script will preserve the aspect ratio of the original images, but will not upscale images and **the original image files are overwritten**, so please make sure you have a backup.

## Requirements
