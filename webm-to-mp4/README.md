# WebM to MP4

This script converts WebM files to MP4 using [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/). The source files are not modified, and the converted files are saved in the same directory as the source files with the same name but with the `.mp4` extension. It can be used to convert singular files or entire directories.

## Requirements

- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
